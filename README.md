# Project: Create a Virtual Machine on Azure

## Description
This project involves creating and configuring a virtual machine on Microsoft Azure. The tasks included setting up a virtual network, creating a resource group, configuring the virtual machine settings, and validating the deployment.

## Key Steps

### Create a Virtual Network and Resource Group:
- Configured a virtual network.
- Created a new resource group named ProjectRG.

### Configure the Virtual Machine:
- Set up the virtual machine named Demo19.
- Configured the NIC network security group to basic.
- Assigned public IP and enabled inbound ports.

### Deploy and Connect to the Virtual Machine:
- Reviewed the configuration and created the virtual machine.
- Connected to the virtual machine using RDP.
